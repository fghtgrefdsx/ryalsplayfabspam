You need to get requests for this to work

go to the microsoft store and download latest python

then  
python --version
If Python is installed, you should see the version number. If not, you need to install Python from python.org.
Check pip Installation:

In the Command Prompt, type:
sh
Copy code
pip --version
This should display the version of pip installed. If it says pip is not recognized, you need to install pip. This typically comes bundled with Python, but you can also install it separately if needed.
Install the requests Module:

In the Command Prompt, type:
sh
Copy code
pip install requests
If you're using Python 3 and the above command doesn't work, you might need to use:
sh
Copy code
pip3 install requests
